- after placing down a non player mob you cant pick one up again for a few seconds
- you cannot pick up ridable mobs like horses


- (debug for carry command sends carry data to server to be synced and also downloads all carry data to sync)


bugs i cant replicate:
- carry desync(not showing on one end essential only?)
- sometimes you are kicked off of someone while being carried (crouching near climbable blocks?)
- various bugs with not being able to pick up people put down (essential only?)
- other player hand doesnt extend when holding (essential only?)
- crouching off while being held causes issues (essential only?)
