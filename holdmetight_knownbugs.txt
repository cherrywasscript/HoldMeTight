- after placing down a non player mob you cant pick one up again for a few seconds
- you cannot pick up ridable mobs like horses

- other player carry positions not saved through death (need to look at the ondeath event to send the new info probably)

- changing dimensions is buggy



bugs i cant replicate:
- carry desync(not showing on one end essential only?)
- pickup desync (not sure of the cause possibly also because of crouching)
- sometimes you are kicked off of someone while being carried (crouching near climbable blocks?)
- various bugs with not being able to pick up people put down (essential only?)
- other player hand doesnt extend when holding (essential only?)
- crouching off while being held causes issues (essential only?)
